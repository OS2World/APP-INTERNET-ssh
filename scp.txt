NAME
       scp - secure copy (remote file copy program)


SYNOPSIS
       scp   [-aAqQprvBCL1]   [-S path-to-ssh]   [-o ssh-options]
       [-P port] [-c cipher] [-i identity]
            [[user@]host1:]filename1...  [[user@]host2:]filename2


DESCRIPTION
       Scp  copies files between hosts on a network.  It uses ssh
       for data transfer, and uses the  same  authentication  and
       provides  the  same security as ssh.  Unlike rcp, scp will
       ask for passwords or passphrases if they  are  needed  for
       authentication.

       Any file name may contain a host and user specification to
       indicate that the file is to be copied to/from that  host.
       Copies between two remote hosts are permitted.


OPTIONS
       -a    Turn on statistics display for each file.

       -A    Turn off statistics display for each file.

       -c cipher
             Selects  the  cipher  to use for encrypting the data
             transfer.  This option is directly passed to ssh.

       -i identity_file
             Selects the file from which  the  identity  (private
             key) for RSA authentication is read.  This option is
             directly passed to ssh.

       -L    Use non privileged port. With this  you  cannot  use
             rhosts   or rsarhosts authentications, but it can be
             used to bypass some firewalls that dont allow privi-
             leged  source  ports  to  pass.  Same  as saying "-o
             UsePriviledgePort=no" or -P to ssh; -L is  used  due
             to exhaustion of suitable letters.

       -1    Force  scp  to use command "scp1" on the remote side
             instead of "scp".  This may  be  necessary  in  some
             situations,  if  the  remote  system has "scp2" sym-
             linked to "scp".

       -o ssh-options
             Ssh options passed to ssh.

       -p    Preserves  modification  times,  access  times,  and
             modes from the original file.

       -q    Turn off statistics display.

       -Q    Turn on statistics display.

       -r    Recursively copy entire directories.

       -v    Verbose mode.  Causes scp and ssh to print debugging
             messages about their progress.  This is  helpful  in
             debugging connection, authentication, and configura-
             tion problems.

       -B    Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or
             passphrases).

       -C    Compression  enable.   Passes  the -C flag to ssh to
             enable compression.

       -P port
             Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.
             Note  that  this option is written with a capital P,
             because -p is already reserved  for  preserving  the
             times and modes of the file in rcp.

       -S path-to-ssh
             Specifies the path to ssh program.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       You   can  turn  scp  statistics  on  or  off  by  setting
       SSH_SCP_STATS or SSH_NO_SCP_STATS  environment  variables.
       To  turn  on  or  off  scp  statistics  for each file, use
       SSH_ALL_SCP_STATS  or   SSH_NO_ALL_SCP_STATS   environment
       variables.  The default value of the statistics can be set
       when the ssh is configured.  Next  the  scp  checks  those
       environment variables and after that command line options.
