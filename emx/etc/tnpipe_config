#
# This is a sample configuration file for tnpipe, the telnetd->sshd pipe tool.
# Put it into your ${ETC} directory, and change according to your taste/needs.
#
# General syntax for a line is:
#
# [Keyword] [Value]
#
# Lines that start with the '#' character are completely ignored.
# The character case does not matter in keyword (and does in `value').
# When keyword is said to accept a string value, you should provide either
# a double-quoted string (i.e. "string") or, if your string does not contain
# space and tab characters, you can omit the quotes. The quoted strings
# can contain C-like quoted characters: \n, \r, \t, \xhexval, \\, \"
#
# The following keywords are recognized:
#
# init-script [string]
#   Define the telnetd session initialization script. Equal to empty string
#   by default. This script is run by telnetdc.exe in the newly created
#   telnet session. You can set environment variables and run any program
#   you like from there. The TCPIP\BIN directory contains a sample session
#   initialization script called TELNETD.CMD; however it does not contain
#   anything useful for sshd sessions thus it is not used by default.
#
# translate-from [string]
#   Set source character translation string.
#
# translate-to [string]
#   Set target character translation string. As characters are emmited
#   to the screen, every character found in [translate-from] string is
#   replaced by the character in corresponding place in [translate-to]
#   string. Thus, the following statements:
#     translate-from "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
#     translate-to "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
#   will tell the terminal emulator to replace all lower-case latin
#   characters with their respective upper-case counterpart.
#   Note that the translation table has inverse meaning as well, i.e.
#   characters read from stdin and found in the [translate-to] string
#   will be replaced by respective characters in the [translate-from]
#   table. Thus, the direction of encoding can be represented as:
#
#                        from ---<---<---<---<--- to
#                  [os/2-server]----------[remote-client]
#                        from --->--->--->--->--- to
#
#   The only character that has special meaning is space: space cannot
#   be encoded any way: neither from->to or to->from. You still can
#   translate a character into space, but not vice versa.
