#
# This is a sample configuration file for ssh/2 built-in terminal emulator.
# Put it into your ${ETC} directory, and change according to your taste/needs.
#
# General syntax for a line is:
#
# [Keyword] [Value]
#
# Lines that start with the '#' character are completely ignored.
# The character case does not matter in keyword (and does in `value').
# When keyword is said to accept a string value, you should provide either
# a double-quoted string (i.e. "string") or, if your string does not contain
# space and tab characters, you can omit the quotes. The quoted strings
# can contain C-like quoted characters: \n, \r, \t, \xhexval, \\, \"
#
# The following keywords are recognized:
#
# key [key-id] [value]
#   Define a string to be emitted when user presses some key.
#   [key-id] is a combination of "ctrl", "alt", "shift" modifiers,
#   a plus sign and a key designator.
#   The following key names are defined:
#     a..z, 0..9, enter, bs (for backspace), f1..f12,
#     home, end, pgup, pgdn, center, ins, del, tab, space, prtsc,
#     pad+, pad-, pad*, pad/, padenter, up, down, left, right,
#     +, -, *, /, \, [, ], ;, ', ,, ., /, `.
#   Not all key combinations are valid (i.e. "ctrl+prtsc" is accepted,
#   while "alt+prtsc" is rejected).
#   [value] is a string (see above the rules for strings).
#
# translate-from [string]
#   Set source character translation string.
#
# translate-to [string]
#   Set target character translation string. As characters are emmited
#   to the screen, every character found in [translate-from] string is
#   replaced by the character in corresponding place in [translate-to]
#   string. Thus, the following statements:
#     translate-from "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
#     translate-to "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
#   will tell the terminal emulator to replace all lower-case latin
#   characters with their respective upper-case counterpart.
#   Note that the translation table has inverse meaning as well, i.e.
#   characters read from stdin and found in the [translate-to] string
#   will be replaced by respective characters in the [translate-from]
#   table. Thus, the direction of encoding can be represented as:
#
#                        to ---<---<---<---<--- from
#                [os/2-workstation]----------[remote-server]
#                        to --->--->--->--->--- from
#
#   The only character that has special meaning is space: space cannot
#   be encoded any way: neither from->to or to->from. You still can
#   translate a character into space, but not vice versa.
#   Please keep in mind that escape sequences (i.e. those that you define
#   the `key' keyword) do not pass through the translation mechanism.
#
# term [string]
#   Tell remote that you have terminal type [string]. By default ssh passes
#   the value of TERM environment variable; however most often you will want
#   to override the environment variable because of ssh's internal terminal
#   emulator that has lots more features than "ansi" or "os2" terminal that
#   most os/2 users have TERM set to. The emulated terminal is a subset of
#   "xterm-color" terminal, thus this is the default term setting.
#
# bell [number] [number]
#   Define default bell pitch/duration. The first number is frequency
#   in hertz, second is duration in 1/1000 seconds (i.e. milliseconds).
#   If you want no bell, set to 0 0. Default bell is 750 125.
#
# backspace-sends [string]
#   Set the character sent by backspace key. Normally an X-Term sends
#   the <delete> character (code 127); however most other terminals
#   send <backspace> (code 8). The string can be equal to either
#   "backspace", "bs", "delete", "del".
#

# Terminal type
term xterm-color

# Bell frequency/duration
bell 3000 30

# The code for <backspace> key: either "backspace" or "delete"
backspace-sends backspace

# Save/restore attribute on save/restore cursor position sequence?
# Some ugly telnet servers (e.g. OS/2 telnetd) don't like this.
save-cursor-attr on

# Honor DEC VT52/ANSI keypad mode switch? This option enables or disables
# switching the keypad from/to "numeric/application mode" (most cursor keys
# work differently than defined in terminal configuration file in this mode).
# Normally applications should not have problems with this, but if you want
# your definitions for cursor keys always work like you defined here,
# disable this option. Keep in mind though that disabling this option
# CAN cause problems as well as resolving them.
allow-keypad-switch on

# Some people likes underline color different that blue :-)

#-- Key redefinition examples

# Linux terminal-like functional keys
#key f1 "\e[[A" f2 "\e[[B" f3 "\e[[C" f4 "\e[[D" f5 "\e[[E"
# Bind alt+function keys to something useful
#key alt+f1 "ls -la" alt+f2 "mount -t vfat /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy"
